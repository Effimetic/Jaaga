# Nashath Booking - Project Summary

## üöÄ **Unified Booking System Implementation Complete!**

### **Overview**
This project has been successfully refactored from a divergent booking system with separate models for public/agent/owner bookings into a **unified, single-booking-model system** that handles all channels through one consistent pipeline.

### **Key Achievements**
- ‚úÖ **Single Booking Model**: All bookings (Public, Agent, Owner) use one `Booking` table
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Pricing Engine**: Schedules pull ticket types & tax rules from Owner Settings
- ‚úÖ **6-Char Alphanumeric Codes**: Collision-safe booking codes for SMS integration
- ‚úÖ **Unified API**: Single set of endpoints for all booking operations
- ‚úÖ **Financial Integration**: Built-in commission system and ledger structure

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Core Data Models (`models/unified_booking.py`)**
- **`TicketType`**: Configurable ticket types (ECO, VIP, Child) with base prices, refundable status, baggage rules
- **`TaxProfile`**: Flexible tax profiles with percentage/fixed rates, applies_to rules, and configurable rounding
- **`ScheduleTicketType`**: Junction table linking schedules to ticket types with surcharge/discount modifiers
- **`Booking`**: Unified booking model for all channels (PUBLIC, AGENT, OWNER) with 6-char codes
- **`BookingTicket`**: Individual tickets within a booking with passenger details
- **`SeatAssignment`**: Seat management system for chart-based boats
- **`LedgerAccount`**: Chart of accounts for multi-tenant financial system
- **`LedgerEntry` & `LedgerLine`**: Double-entry bookkeeping system
- **`ReceivableSnapshot`**: Real-time receivable tracking for agents and public
- **`SettlementStatement`**: Settlement statements between boat owners and app owner

### **2. Pricing Engine (`services/pricing_engine.py`)**
- **Automatic price calculation** based on ticket types + tax profiles + schedule modifiers
- **Channel-specific pricing** (PUBLIC: no commission, AGENT: commission applied, OWNER: special discounts)
- **App owner fee integration** (MVR 10 per booking, configurable)
- **Tax calculation** with configurable rules, rounding, and applies_to logic
- **Validation** of ticket types for schedules
- **Real-time pricing** with no hard-coded values

### **3. Unified Booking Service (`services/unified_booking.py`)**
- **Single booking creation** for all channels with consistent logic
- **Automatic 6-char alphanumeric code generation** (collision-safe, excludes O, I)
- **Seat assignment management** with validation
- **Status management** (payment, fulfillment, finance statuses)
- **Booking cancellation** with automatic seat restoration
- **Comprehensive booking summaries** with line-item breakdowns

### **4. API Routes (`routes/unified_booking.py`)**
- **`GET /api/schedules/{id}/bookings`**: Get all bookings for a schedule with filtering
- **`POST /api/schedules/{id}/bookings`**: Create new booking (all channels)
- **`GET /api/bookings/{id}`**: Get detailed booking information
- **`GET /api/bookings/code/{code}`**: Public endpoint for SMS ticket lookup
- **Role-based access control** for all endpoints

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database & Migration**

### **Database Schema**
- **New unified tables** created alongside existing legacy tables
- **Foreign key relationships** properly established
- **Indexes** for performance on booking codes, owner IDs, schedule IDs
- **JSON fields** for flexible metadata storage (line items, meta, baggage rules)

### **Migration Strategy**
- **Non-destructive migration** preserving all existing data
- **New tables** created with proper constraints
- **Legacy system** continues to work during transition
- **Gradual migration** possible with feature flags

### **Data Integrity**
- **Unique constraints** on booking codes and ticket type codes
- **Cascade deletes** for related records
- **Transaction safety** with rollback on errors
- **Audit trails** with created_at/updated_at timestamps

## üîÑ **System Architecture**

### **Service Layer Pattern**
- **PricingEngine**: Handles all pricing calculations
- **UnifiedBookingService**: Manages booking operations
- **Separation of concerns** between pricing, booking, and data access

### **API Design**
- **RESTful endpoints** following best practices
- **Consistent response formats** across all endpoints
- **Error handling** with proper HTTP status codes
- **Authentication & authorization** integrated with existing system

### **Financial System Integration**
- **Double-entry bookkeeping** ready for implementation
- **Commission tracking** for app owner (MVR 10 per booking)
- **Receivable management** for agents and public customers
- **Settlement statements** for periodic payouts

## üìñ **Usage Examples**

### **Creating a Ticket Type**
```python
# Owner creates ticket types
ticket_type = TicketType(
    owner_id=owner.id,
    name="Economy Class",
    code="ECO",
    base_price=150.00,
    currency="MVR",
    refundable=True
)
```

### **Setting Up a Tax Profile**
```python
# Owner creates tax profile
tax_profile = TaxProfile(
    owner_id=owner.id,
    name="Domestic VAT + Green Tax",
    lines=[
        {"name": "VAT", "type": "PERCENT", "value": 8, "applies_to": "FARE"},
        {"name": "Green Tax", "type": "FIXED", "value": 5, "applies_to": "TOTAL"}
    ],
    rounding_rule="ROUND_UP"
)
```

### **Creating a Schedule with Ticket Types**
```python
# Schedule now uses ticket types instead of hard prices
schedule = Schedule(
    owner_id=owner.id,
    boat_id=boat.id,
    # ... other fields
    # No more public_rate, agent_rate fields
)

# Link ticket types to schedule
schedule_ticket_type = ScheduleTicketType(
    schedule_id=schedule.id,
    ticket_type_id=eco_ticket.id,
    surcharge=10.00,  # Weekend surcharge
    discount=0.00
)
```

### **Making a Booking**
```python
# Unified booking for any channel
booking_data = {
    "channel": "PUBLIC",  # or "AGENT" or "OWNER"
    "buyer_name": "John Doe",
    "buyer_phone": "+960 1234567",
    "tickets": [
        {
            "ticket_type_id": eco_ticket.id,
            "passenger_name": "John Doe"
        }
    ]
}

service = UnifiedBookingService(owner_id, schedule_id)
booking = service.create_booking(booking_data)
# Returns: {"code": "ABC123", "grand_total": 165.00}
```
